Purchases land in Final Fantasy XIV.

A simple python program written to practice and familiarize myself with PyQT interfacing. 

Uses win32api to hook into the process and send virtual keypresses. This allows a user to effectively script the process of starting the dialogue with an NPC, selecting
correct options and attempting to purchase the house which uses a random chance lottery system. 

Autohotkey scripts exist with this functionality but these require that the user have the focus on the game at the time of use.

This program aims to bypass that and allows an easy method of changing the delay between keypresses with a functional yet simple GUI. The win32api allows processes to receive
virtual key input regardless of if the window is focused or not since it hooks into the process itself.
